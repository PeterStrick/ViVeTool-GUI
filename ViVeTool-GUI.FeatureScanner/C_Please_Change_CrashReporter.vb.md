# Please change CrashReporter.vb yourself. 

I do not wish to scramble my brain trying to figure out where ViVeTool GUI is crashing, before figuring out that that Crash Report came from a Git Clone or Fork.

## You can change the SendReport() Sub of CrashReporter.vb using one of the following **templates** as it is the only part that needs changing:

### Template 1: Analyze with DrDump using your own Application GUID

When you create a new Application in DrDump, you will automatically get an autogenerated GUID to use in your Clone/Fork. To do this you need to sign up for a [free DrDump Account](https://drdump.com/crash-reporting-system), and create an Application on DrDump.

The only thing you need to replace is the `YOUR GUID HERE` text with your own GUID that you got from DrDump.

```vbnet
Private Shared Sub SendReport(exception As Exception)
        Dim reportCrash = New ReportCrash(Nothing) With {
            .AnalyzeWithDoctorDump = True,
            .CaptureScreen = False,
            .DoctorDumpSettings = New DoctorDumpSettings With {
                .ApplicationID = New Guid("YOUR GUID HERE")
            },
            .EmailRequired = False,
            .IncludeScreenshot = True,
            .ShowScreenshotTab = True,
            .DeveloperMessage = "Application Settings:" & Environment.NewLine & "AutoLoad: " & My.Settings.AutoLoad & Environment.NewLine & "Dark Mode: " & My.Settings.DarkMode & Environment.NewLine & "Use System Theme: " & My.Settings.UseSystemTheme
        }
        reportCrash.Send(exception)
End Sub
```

### Template 2: Use your own SMTP Server to send you an email when a crash occurs

This is similar to Template 1, although requires an SMTP Server and a bit more effort. [Source](https://github.com/ravibpatel/CrashReporter.NET#use-smtp-to-send-crash-reports-directly-to-email)

```vbnet
Private Shared Sub SendReport(exception As Exception)
        Dim reportCrash = New ReportCrash(Nothing) With {
            .AnalyzeWithDoctorDump = False,
            .CaptureScreen = False,
            .EmailRequired = True,
            .IncludeScreenshot = True,
            .ShowScreenshotTab = True,
            .DeveloperMessage = "Application Settings:" & Environment.NewLine & "AutoLoad: " & My.Settings.AutoLoad & Environment.NewLine & "Dark Mode: " & My.Settings.DarkMode & Environment.NewLine & "Use System Theme: " & My.Settings.UseSystemTheme,
            .SmtpHost = "Your SMTP Host here",
            .Port = 587, 'Replace this with your SMTP Port
            .EnableSSL = true, 'Enable SSL if needed
            .UserName = "Your Email",
            .Password = "Your Email Password",
            .ToEmail = "Email Address where you want to receive crash reports",
            .FromEmail = "Your Email or Alias"
        }
        reportCrash.Send(exception)
End Sub
```

### Other Things to Note:

```vbnet
.AnalyzeWithDoctorDump = True,
```

Setting this to True will Analayse CrashRepots with DrDump and send Emails using DrDump

---

```vbnet
.CaptureScreen = False,
```

Setting this to True will Screenshot the entire Screen instead of only the Application Window. Setting it to false is recommended.

---

```vbnet
.IncludeScreenshot = True,
.ShowScreenshotTab = True,
```

These will determine if a Screenshot of ViVeTool GUI should be taken. 

Setting IncludeScreenshot to `True` will make a Screenshot of ViVeTool GUI

Setting ShowScreenshotTab to `True` will show the Screenshot Tab, allowing you to either send the taken Screenshot / Create one, or to not send it.

---

```vbnet
.DeveloperMessage = "Application Settings:" & Environment.NewLine & "AutoLoad: " & My.Settings.AutoLoad & Environment.NewLine & "Dark Mode: " & My.Settings.DarkMode & Environment.NewLine & "Use System Theme: " & My.Settings.UseSystemTheme
```

The DeveloperMessage will show any additional Information on the CrashDump on DrDump or in the sent Email. In this case it tells you, what application settings are currently enabled or disabled. See Image:
