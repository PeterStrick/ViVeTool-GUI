# Building ViVeTool GUI / ViVeTool GUI - Feature Scanner
## Build Requirements:
- ViVeTool GUI was created in Visual Studio 2022. Older Versions may not work.
- Windows 10 Version 2004 / Windows 11
- Microsoft .Net Framework 4.8.1

## The first time you open up the solution, youÂ´ll be met with Reference Issues.
To fix the Reference Issues for Albacore.ViVe, use the DLL from the `lib` Folder or [build it yourself](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/tree/master/ViVe)

To fix the Reference Issues for AutoUpdater.NET, Sentry and Newtonsoft.JSON, open the Package Manager Console.
You will be asked if you want to restore the NuGet packages, do so by pressing on Restore.

To fix the Reference Issues for the Telerik libraries either use the DLLs from the `lib\RCWF\2021.3.1109.40` Folder or install the [Telerik UI for WinForms Suite (login required to download installer)](https://www.telerik.com/login/ui-for-winforms).

### You will not be able to access the Visual Studio Designer if you do not have the Telerik UI for WinForms Suite installed.

### However, you will be able to build ViVeTool GUI by referencing the Telerik libraries in the `lib\RCWF\2021.3.1109.40` folder.

# **It is also highly recommended to change SentryHandler.\*.vb, see [Please change SentryHandler.\*.vb](https://github.com/PeterStrick/ViVeTool-GUI/blob/master/vivetool-gui/C_Please_Change_SentryHandler.vb.md)**
